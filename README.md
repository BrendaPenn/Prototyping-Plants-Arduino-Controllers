# Prototyping-Plants-Arduino-Controllers
This has the code that connects to our controllers for the sun and the seed inputs in our game and connects to write to the keyboard to control the p5js game. 


Create game controllers for input into a p5js game by using the arudino to write to the keyboard. 
Using an Arduino Leonardo, created two controllers to control the seed and the sun in the game.
